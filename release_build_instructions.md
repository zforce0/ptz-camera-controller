4. On your Android tablet, browse to the APK file and tap it to install
   - You may need to allow installation from unknown sources in Settings > Security

## Option 3: Use Google Play Store (Coming Soon)

In the future, the app will be available through the Google Play Store for easier installation.

## Connecting to the Onboard Computer

After installation, follow these steps to connect to the PTZ Camera System:

1. Ensure both your tablet and onboard computer (Raspberry Pi or Jetson) are on the same network

2. Launch the PTZ Camera Control app on your tablet

3. On the Connection screen, choose WiFi or Bluetooth connection method

4. For WiFi, enter the IP address of the onboard computer (default port is 8000)

5. For Bluetooth, select the "PTZCameraServer" device from the list of available Bluetooth devices

6. Once connected, you'll be able to view the camera stream and control PTZ functions

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

3. Verify Bluetooth is enabled on both devices (for Bluetooth connections)

4. Check the logs on the onboard computer for any error messages

5. If streaming issues occur, try the lower quality stream through settings
